      <b>About Me</b>
      <p>
        My name is Park Seohyeon from South Korea. When I was young, I moved from Korea to Vietnam. Since I suddenly went abroad, I had more hobbies that I could enjoy alone at home. Among them, I spent a lot of time playing games. I was absorbed in games, and I enjoyed games like Mario Kart on the Nintendo Wii among the Nintendo series. When I was choosing exam subjects or thinking about college, I suddenly realised that I wanted to make games, so I came to university in Japan, the country that made Nintendo, the game console I played the most when I was young. Living as a foreigner in Vietnam for 10 years has reduced my fear of studying abroad again and living as a foreigner. Like this, living in Vietnam, where I had many good and bad experiences, helped me choose to study abroad, which I would never have done if I had continued to live in Korea.
